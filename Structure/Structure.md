We can declare structure inside function. It is called as local structure.

We can not create object/pointer of local structure outside function.

If we create, object of the structure then all the members declared inside structure get space inside object.

Using object, If we want to access members of structure then we should use dot / member selection operator.

Using pointer, If we want to access members of structure then we should use arrow operator.

<!-- Structure in C++ -->

We can define function inside structure.
To create object of structure keyword struct is optional.
Structure members are by default considered as public.
