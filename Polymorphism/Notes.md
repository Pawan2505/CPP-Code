<!-- Polymorphism definition: -->

-> An ability of an object to take multiple forms is called as polymorphism.

<!-- Types of polymorphism: -->

 <!-- 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism -->
 
Also known as static polymorphism, compile-time polymorphism is resolved during the compilation of the program. This type of polymorphism allows for method or operator resolution based on compile-time information.

<!-- We can achieve it using 3 ways: -->

         -> Function overloading
         -> Operator overloding
         -> Template


<!--2. Run time polymorphism -->

         -> Also called as dynamic typing
         -> We can achieve it using:
         -> Function overriding
