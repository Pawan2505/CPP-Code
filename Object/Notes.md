Variable of a class is called as object.

Object is also called as instance.

<!-- Example :  -->

class Employee emp1; //OK
Employee emp; //OK


<!-- Process of creating object from class is called as instantiation; -->

<!-- C: -->

struct Structure_Name object_name;

<!-- C++ -->

Structure_Name object_name;

Class_Name object_name;


<!-- Employee emp;  -->
Here class Employee is instantiated and name of the
instance is emp.
