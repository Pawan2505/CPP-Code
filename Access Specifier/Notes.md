If we want to control visibility of the members of structure/class then we should use access specifier.

<!-- Access Specifiers in C++: -->

If we want to control the visibility of the members of a structure/class, we should use access specifiers.

1. private: Members are accessible only within the same class or structure.

2. protected: Members are accessible within the same class, and by derived classes.

3. public: Members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
