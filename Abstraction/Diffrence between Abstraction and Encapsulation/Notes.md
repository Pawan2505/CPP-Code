<!-- Abstraction : -->

-> Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

<!-- Example:  -->

-> A car's steering wheel is an abstraction; you use it to turn the car without knowing how the steering mechanism works.

<!-- Encapsulation: -->

-> Encapsulation is the technique of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of data hiding.

<!-- Example:  -->

-> A car engine is encapsulated; you cannot directly access the engineâ€™s internals without specific tools and knowledge.
